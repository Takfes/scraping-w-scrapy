{"title": "The Balvenie Doublewood 12", "price": "69.99", "vendor": "The Balvenie", "description": "2018 marked the 25th anniversary of The Balvenie DoubleWood, aged 12 years. This milestone is not only a testament to the craftsmen who have dedicated their working lives to making Balvenie the handcrafted way but to the skill of our Malt Master who throughout his 55 year career has changed the face of Scotch, work which earned him an MBE in 2016. DoubleWood 12 was launched in 1993, using a process designed by our Malt Master David Stewart in 1982, now commonly known as 'wood finishing'. To make The Balvenie DoubleWood, David Stewart MBE takes whisky that has spent at least 12 years in traditional whisky casks, American Oak ex-bourbon barrels and hogsheads, and moves it to Spanish oak ex-Oloroso sherry casks for an additional nine months. The whisky is then transferred to large oak vessels called \u201ctuns\u201d for 3-4 months to allow the whiskies from individual casks to \u201cmarry\u201d. The Balvenie DoubleWood single malt whisky gains its distinctive character from being matured in two different wood types. Each stage lends different qualities to the resulting single malt whisky. The traditional casks soften and add delicate character, the sherry wood brings depth and fullness of flavour and the final few months in our tuns allow the whiskies to marry harmoniously. Nose: Sweet fruit and Oloroso sherry notes, layered with honey and vanilla. Taste: Smooth and mellow with beautifully combined flavours ~ nutty sweetness, cinnamon spiciness and a delicately proportioned layer of sherry. Finish: Long and Warming"},

We don't believe in rotating barrels. We feel Bourbon is aged best with the barrel racked on its side, and undisturbed. Every time a barrel is rolled around, it breaks char off of the staves.

{"title": "Stolen Overproof Rum", "price": "23.99", "vendor": "Stolen", "description": "This is Stolen Overproof Rum. Bartenders love it. Smart drinkers listen to their bartenders. We found this rare stock at a historic, 250 year old family-run sugar estate and distillery in Jamaica, renowned for making some of the best heavy pot still rums in the world. Like other Jamaican rums, Stolen Overproof Rum uses dunder (the liquid left in a boiler after distilling a batch of rum) as a traditional flavor source. Unlike other Jamaican rums, this rum is the last of a 6-year aged rum distilled using very old, traditional pot stills; the same as those found in Scotland to make superior single malt whiskies. Mountain rain water collected by the estate\u2019s own rain water retention system is a key ingredient. The sugar cane is grown entirely on the estate and hand-harvested by local farmers. The sugar cane mash is fermented using a proprietary yeast strand that is cultured in outdoor wooden vats. After the distillation, the rum is carefully matured in ex-whiskey barrels. The result is a distinctively smooth 123 proof dark bronze rum with extraordinary complexity and depth of flavor. The nose is not the wet grass one might expect but rather offers a dose of white and black pepper spice married with charred oak and ripe banana. On the palate, there is a hint of charred vanilla along with notes of tangerine, banana, and pear. The rum has medium viscosity and lovely long legs, leaving a luscious light coat in your mouth."},

He was America\u2019s first ambassador to France and, while there, fell in love with the finest wines of Bordeaux. Once of his favorites was the Chateau Pichon Baron, an exceptional red wine. Based on our experience finishing Jefferson\u2019s in creative ways and in various types of casks, we felt strongly that the Pichon Baron wine and the toasted staves of the French oak wine casks would complement our well age, complex Kentucky Straight Bourbon whiskey. After hand selecting a limited number of Pichon Baron barrels, refilling them with Jefferson\u2019s Reserve bourbon and extra aging them in our proprietary \u201chot box\u201d environment, we have created a one-of-a-kind whiskey that combines the robust flavors of the Bordeaux, the wood notes of both American and French oak and the grain of a premium bourbon in a delicious, complex and balanced final product."},

Reminiscent of Voyage 15, the less flavorful wheat allowed the sweetness of the corn to build through the maturation process. Once barreled and put to sea, the bourbon was immediately and continually influenced by the salt air and constant movement of the ship. OCEAN Voyage 19 traveled to 30 ports on 5 continents and crossed the Equator 4 times in the process. With each crossing, there was an extreme contrast in temperature as the ship transitioned from winter to summer and vice versa without the buffer of spring and fall. Extreme heat caused the sugars of the corn to caramelize in the wood and work their way into the bourbon as the wood contracted with the extreme fall in temperature. Without having to compete with the spice of the rye, the bourbon of OCEAN Voyage 19 took on a great deal of vanilla and salted caramel corn as its dominate flavor with a subtle wood finish."},

Only the best grapes of the most exceptional years are used, making each vintage distinct. It is the perfect embodiment of the Power of Creation \u2013 an act of creation that elevates the mind and enlightens the world. 2010. Winter was rigorous, spring dry and late. After a particularly sunny decade, such freshness was surprising. Summer was hot, but not excessively so. Then, two days of diluvian rain brought this ideal trajectory to a halt. In just a few days, botrytis mold developed on the grapes, mainly on the pinot noir. This triggered a race against the clock. The grapes were not yet fully mature, but a decision had to be made quickly. Dom P\u00e9rignon deployed its full resources to trace a precise map delimiting the maturity and health of each parcel in its vineyards. Every minute counted. This expert vision of the situation gave the possibility of saving excellent plots of pinot noir grapes. The challenge was met, Dom P\u00e9rignon declared a vintage quite literally \u201csaved from the waters\u201d: Dom P\u00e9rignon Vintage 2010, fruit of intuition and mastery.

A tactile sensation of peony, jasmine and lilac. Palate - The wine immediately imposes its ample presence, full and massive. A sappy sensation dominates as the tactile is rapidly overtaken by the aromatic. The body unfolds: generous, firm and controlled. Then it contracts, letting the wine vibrate with spices and pepper. The energy is sustained to a scintillating, saline finish."},

Waves crash against the white brick \u2018LAPHROAIG\u2019 walls with awesome ferocity. Think wrath of the sea rather than hint of maritime, here. Recognized the world round for everything medicinal: not only are distillery bottlings presented in an apothecary-style green and white bottle, evocative of nightmarish childhood visits to the medicine cabinet, many also perceive its flavor profile a close relative to cough medicine, whilst others lap it up for its fiercely acquired taste. Definitely a love-it-or-hate-it type dram. The distinctly medicinal flavor characteristic that is found in the spirit produced at Laphroaig is a result of the peat utilized during the malting process, which like very few distilleries in Scotland is still conducted at the site of the distillery in a traditional manner. The distillery maintains access to its own unique peat beds, at Glen Machrie, whose peat contains relatively high levels of \u2018Sphagnum\u2019, which develop iodine-like flavors during production. On top of the potency of raw ingredients used at Laphroaig, the distillery\u2019s process retains a large amount of phenols (ppm) in its new-make, making its whisky a fierce beast that requires robust maturation to develop graceful. Well-matured expressions, however, are absolutely sublime."},

{"title": "Ardbeg Uigeadail", "price": "93.99", "vendor": "Ardbeg", "description": "As deep and mysterious as the loch that gives it its name! Ardbeg is the peatiest and smokiest of all the Islay malts, yet has a fruity floral sweetness and complexity to the spirit. Ardbeg Uigeadail Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky is a special vatting that marries Ardbeg\u2019s traditional deep, smoky notes with luscious, raisiny tones of old ex-Sherry casks. Ardbeg Uigeadail (pronounced \u201cOog-a-dal\u201d) takes its name from the mysterious loch which supplies the peat-laden water used to make Ardbeg. Typically most whiskies are chill-filtered and reduced to a strength of 40% ABV. Ardbeg Uigeadail, however, is non chill-filtered at high strength (54.2% ABV non chill-filtered), which retains maximum flavor and gives more body and added depth. TASTING NOTES Colour: Deepest gold. Aroma: Rich and weighty with heady and smoky aromatics, this expression of Ardbeg is both intensely flavoured and perfectly integrated. At full strength, the initial aroma is a beguiling mix of warm Christmas cake, walnut oil and parma violets fused with fresh ocean spice, cedar and pine needles falling from the Christmas tree. A smouldering smoky coal fire and the deep scent of well-oiled leather brings warmth to the scene. The sweetness of treacle toffees and chocolate-coated raisins bring indulgence through the smoke. With water, the deep smokiness increases in intensity, reminiscent of a Christmas pudding on fire. Tarry smoke and diesel engine oil enter the room bringing smells of an age gone by. Rich flowering currants and warm baked banana and walnut bread are served with simmering mocha espresso. Taste: Full-flavoured and rich with a deep mouth-coating texture, the taste is an intriguing balance between sweet, spicy and deep smoky flavours. The flavour is initially sweet as Christmas cake begins to soak into the tongue. A burst of winter spices sets off a smoky-spicy explosion countered by a sumptuous mid-palate of honey glazed smoked food and chewy treacle. Waves of deep smoky tones and rich aromas build up on the palate like a fine Montecristo cigar. Finish: Amazingly long and chewy with lingering raisiny, deep mocha tones and rich aromatic smoke into the perfectly integrated finish"},

Unlike traditional finished whiskey, we do not rest our whiskey in a secondary cask, but finish our whiskey in-bottle. We do this by placing a 5\u201d long spiral-cut piece of wood, cut from the same species of wood as the finishing barrel into our bottle. In Bourbon & Brew, we cut a Spire from French Oak, porous and rich, containing nearly twice the amount of natural botanicals as American Oak, creating a rich, deep, silky finish. FIRE MEDIUM+ TOAST Before we infuse the Spire of wood into West Oak Cold Brew Coffee, we expose it to fire, toasting the wood to a perfect degree that will produce a finish that is deep and rich with subtle notes of fruit and vanilla. INFUSION WEST OAK COLD BREW COFFEE West Oak Coffee, based in Denton, TX, has made a name for itself in the craft coffee world, roasting some of the finest coffees found in America. We partnered with West Oak to create Bourbon & Brew, using Delagua Coffee from Colombia. Before bottling, we infuse the Spires into this rich, savory cold brew, giving a sweet, delicate dark chocolate & coffee finish, unlike anything else."},

{"title": "FEW Breakfast Bourbon Whiskey", "price": "54.99", "vendor": "FEW Spirits", "description": "It was only a matter of time before Illinois's FEW Spirits followed up their beloved Breakfast Gin with a whiskey counterpart. Once that decision was made, it couldn't have been too much effort or conversation to arrive at the method - a maple cask finish is just too hard to resist. Released two years ago now, it arrived alongside a handful of other maple finished whiskey releases and yielded extremely tasty results. The practice has proven to be so wildly popular in fact, that most producers have been unable to keep up with demand. It would seem we all hold a special place in our heart for that sweet maple. As luck would have it, a handful of cases were set aside at a special place in the distillery a couple of years ago, and recently rediscovered. The good folks at FEW sent them our way, and we're excited to to share this deliciously indulgent spirit with you! It begins with FEW's flagship bourbon, aged at least four years before being transferred to barrels which were previously used to hold maple syrup (Mount Mansfield Maple of Vermont - a producer who has landed on Oprah's \"Favorite Things\" list a few times now.) The time in this secondary barrel lends a kiss of maple to the bourbon's profile of cinnamon, clove, and herbal rye, without overwhelming or coming off as a \"flavored\" whiskey. Sips beautifully neat, but don't resist that urge to mix up a lush and autumnal Old Fashioned, Manhattan, or shaken up in a Maple Whiskey Sour."},

Stagg, comes in at a lower 116.9 proof this year. This is the lowest proof in this whiskey\u2019s history. Master Distiller Harlen Wheatley cites barrels located on the lower warehouse floors as the reason. \u201cMany of the barrels for this year\u2019s Stagg composite were taken from the first floor of the warehouse. The first floor is cooler with higher humidity levels, therefore the alcohol evaporates faster than the water.\u201d The taste, however, is still what Stagg fans can expect, vanilla and toasted oak with a floral undertone, followed by a long finish of cherries, coffee and black pepper. Past releases of this uncut and unfiltered bourbon have won many top awards, including last year\u2019s release capturing the Chairman\u2019s Trophy at the Ultimate Spirits Competition. This year\u2019s release contains bourbon from barrels filled in the spring of 2004. Storage location of these barrels varied across warehouses C, H, I, K, and Q.

{"title": "Alexander Murray Glenlossie 19 Year Old 1997", "price": "113.99", "vendor": "Alexander Murray", "description": "A curious case of non-identical twins, Glenlossie shares the same site, warehousing, water source and even staff as its sister distillery, Mannochmore, on the banks of the river Lossie near Elgin on Speyside. Blending giant, Diageo, owns both and each distillery contributes different spirit profiles to contribute to the company\u2019s wider blending program. Perhaps \u2018twins\u2019 is inaccurate, as Glenlossie is the original distillery built in 1876; Mannochmore was later added, in 1971. Glenlossie is responsible for a style of single malt that is almost unique amongst distilleries \u2013 best known for its subtle oily character, which results from bulbous stills that incorporate purifiers, a scarcely adopted technique in the Scotch whisky industry. This profile can become almost cream-like during maturation, whilst retaining bursts of grassiness and intense candied fruit. Glenlossie\u2019s significant difference in style to adjacent Mannochmore (fruity rather than oily) goes to show just how influential distillation parameters are in creating flavor within a spirit, given that all else is the same. It\u2019s never right to choose between siblings, but in this case we have to: Glenlossie is the hands-down favorite at Alexander Murray & Co."},

{"title": "Alexander Murray Dailuaine 16 Year Old 1997", "price": "129.99", "vendor": "Alexander Murray", "description": "Mega-Rare alert! Single malt expressions of Dailuaine (pronounced dal-YOU-an) are rather rare indeed. Like many of the distilleries in \u2018team Diageo\u2019, all the spirit here is destined for blending with special bottlings so few and far between that you\u2019re better off standing outside the distillery breathing in its vapor or waiting for a lunar eclipse. If you come across a bottle from this Speysider, you\u2019d better snap it up. Lesser-known for this very reason, it\u2019s a great shame that it\u2019s not seen bottled as a single malt more often as it\u2019s incredibly good. Akin to the likes of Cragganmore, Benrinnes, Mortlach and to an extent Dalwhinnie, Dailuaine plays within the meaty/sulfury spirit profile that is so interesting after maturation. In the case of Dailuaine the meaty character is subtle \u2013 maybe even more nutty/cheesy in its own special way \u2013 although malt and fruit tend to lead. Often seen matured in sherry as well as bourbon due to its ability to stand strong during aggressive maturation. Dailuaine is a tricky one to describe. Best put, from all of us at Alexander Murray & Co: go try it now."},
{"title": "Alexander Murray Allt-a-Bhainne 19 Year Old 1996", "price": "119.99", "vendor": "Alexander Murray", "description": "Perhaps best known for its most unintuitive Gaelic pronunciation [oltah-vain], Allt-a-Bhainne \u2013 meaning \u2018burn of milk\u2019 \u2013 has stood at the foot of Ben Rinnes in Speyside since 1975. Built by its owners, Chivas, its role is to produce a single malt of a particular type for the use in blended whisky. Braeval, its sister distillery (formally Braes of Glenlivet), was built at the same time during ongoing efforts to improve the company\u2019s wider blending program. Allt-a-Bhainne has scarcely enjoyed a faultless reputation over its relatively short life. In fact, the distillery\u2019s rugged fa\u00e7ade and grumpy architecture give its whisky a fairly unromantic perception from the outset, and some of the whiskies from its first decade of production are a little off-the-mark here and there. This is a real shame, as we have latterly found that the distillery has really found its feet, with vintages consistently displaying amazing texture and flavor. Allt-a-Bhainne is not often the most complex single malt in a lineup, but for those who enjoy a somewhat sweet and textured whisky, it\u2019s a champion. \u2018Burn of milk\u2019 \u2013 a sweet, creamy specialist."},

These farms are centrally located on the island, providing a very different terroir to the wild maritime location of our 2007 release from Rockside. TASTE PROFILE: Great structure. Firm, muscular and more complex than expected. Several layers of flavour are melding into a barley sugar and oak mellowed texture while drifting over sweet kiln-dried barley. The senses are singing with joy as it zings over the palate leaving no doubt as to the island of its birth. NOSE : The opening notes are of soft, really ripe gooseberries, fresh pineapple and mango. It is harvest time in a global orchard, sweet red apple, plump green grapes and even a hint of peach. It is a brilliant opening leading you further into the garden where you can enjoy the harmonious aromas of carnations, mimosa and mint. Night scented stocks and lilies drift on a mid-summer breeze, continuing through the golden fields of Islay barley. This is a Hebridean journey like no other, but wait, the sweetest vanilla notes are emerging with hints of spicy bourbon and a touch of toasted oak. Dark plums appear with dates and that Oloroso richness that only Jerez casks can provide. I could sit all day nosing this spirit solely by virtue of the aromatics alone. A very special experience. PALATE : The taste is directed. Malty sweet, cereal, honey, clean and citrus fresh. A stunning example of how trickle distillation using Victorian equipment and 134 years of practice can produce a young spirit that needs not the weight of oak to shine. This sensational succulent young spirit offers candied almonds, hints of toffee apple, nougat wafers, banana, ginger biscuits and sherried sponge. It is a tale of two cities. On the nose the floral aromatics were an Islay welcome to a beautiful marriage of ancient Ozark oak and young Islay barley. The Hebridean halo is gently making its presence felt with a distinctive hint of the marine flavours and character you can only find in a spirit matured on the wild west coast of Islay. FINISH: Enjoy the invitation of an island\u2019s warmth and the sincerity of its people, its history and its future. You are now one of our family. Welcome."},

The solution demands a complex cask management system. Although all of the spirit in Octomore 08.4 is eight years old just 20% has been held full-term in virgin oak. 80% was originally introduced to American oak, first-fill ex-Bourbon casks, before being transferred into the European virgin oak that had previously held Octomore 07.4. TASTING NOTES CHARACTER \u2013 The power of Octomore and virgin oak combine again to show another of the endless possibilities we can create when our focus is on the fundamental elements of whisky making. AROMA \u2013 A little smoke but gentle and warm. The oak comes with sweet honeyed malt and banana bread. The phenolic muddy notes come again now with a peppery, floral edge. With time the oak gives more and more, toffee popcorn, vanilla fudge, coconut, cinnamon. The smoke fades back a little now. TASTE \u2013 A rich texture feels like honey as it slowly builds the flavour of the sweet mellow oak. Leather and toasted wood combine with the delicate smoke. There is balance here as there is no oak notes without an equal and complimenting note from the smoke. Praline, coconut, clove are matched with barbeque, burnt heather and iodine. The spirit behind the smoke and oak brings a lemon and salt spray hit once opened with spring water as well as hints of mint and stewed apple. FINISH \u2013 Clove, aniseed and coffee grounds fade to peat smoke \u2013 the typical, classic Octomore finish that always lingers in your mind. COLOUR \u2013 Autumn leaves"},

A distillery was later added as wheat production began to increase in Upper Canada. Distillation was an efficient way to preserve excess grain that was prone to spoilage, as well as dispose of the grain middlings left over from the milling process. After taking out a patent for a \u201cRiley still\u201d, Gooderham & Worts would fundamentally change distilling in Canada by double distilling whisky through 2 columns making a softer whisky than what was available at the time. By the late 1800\u2019s Toronto\u2019s Gooderham & Worts distillery was the largest in the world. Under the guidance of Doctor Don Livermore, a new Gooderham & Worts Four Grain whisky was launched as a tribute to the original recipe from 1832. It is a premium blend of four diverse grains \u2013 corn, wheat, barley and rye. All four grains are distilled and aged separately before blended, comprised of pot and column distilled wheat, barley and rye, and double column distilled corn. 100% locally sourced grain from Ontario Canada, aged in a combination of new virgin oak casks and used Bourbon casks.

It was a bold move which broke convention, in a Speyside whisky-making region known for crafting unpeated whiskies. The wood rich Highland peat we use to craft peated BenRiach spirit is sourced from the region\u2019s fertile landscape, imparting sweet, smoky campfire notes into our whisky. For over four decades, we have been quietly maturing peated BenRiach spirit in our traditional, earthen floored dunnage warehouses, in an intriguing range of carefully selected casks. Historical whisky research indicates BenRiach was the first distillery within Speyside to reintroduce peated malt into its whisky making. This has led us to believe it holds the oldest maturing peated whiskies in the region, which can now be savoured by those curious to discover a new style of smoky single malt."},

Nested in the rolling hills amongst the trees, it\u2019s hard to argue with its claim to being an age-old site of illicit spirit distillation \u2013 as early as the late eighteenth century apparently. Producing very small volumes of whisky for its owner, Edrington, and rarely seen as a standalone single malt, Glenturret has inherited a slightly anonymous identity over the years. Alongside this, the distillery\u2019s simple and unsophisticated setup naturally yields faintly inconsistent spirit character. This makes Glenturret a jamboree of peculiarities and idiosyncrasies that are so interesting to the seasoned malt drinker. Profile of the spirit character dances between light and perfumed, however what\u2019s usually guaranteed is intensity of flavor. Single malt releases are few and far between, and older vintages of Glenturret are particularly rare."},

{"title": "Porfidio Reposado Tequila", "price": "89.99", "vendor": "Porfidio", "description": "\u2018Reposado\u2019 is by definition a hybrid ageing description particular and exclusive to spirits produced in Hispanic countries. It is hybrid since any Reposado spirit in any spirits category is actually \u201cincompletely\u201d aged for only a few months. This is done deliberately, as such short ageing imbues a white spirit with a slight wood aroma. However, the spirit is still dominated by the raw material aroma prevalent in white, unaged spirits (in our case, blue agave). Consequently, \u2018Reposado\u2019 is neither a true white spirit nor a truly aged spirit, but a hybrid form of these two.\u2018The Reposado by Porfidio\u2019 is fundamentally aligned with this approach, but accommodates the taste to a less ethnically-oriented market. This is achieved by ageing \u2018The Reposado by Porfidio\u2019 for seven months instead of the customary two months; hence it is labelled as Reposado \u201cExtra\u201d.

Changes in ownership have created subtle ripples of change in spirit profile over the years. Typically, older vintages are ever-so-lightly-peated and have rested in ex-bourbon casks which lend lovely characteristics to the whisky\u2019s development. The \u2018Bruichladdich with a wisp\u2019 vintages are lively and delicious. Today its methods and attitude are rebellious with multiple-spirit characters matured on site in a myriad of cask types.

The Pechuga production season is limited to year-end due to the special ingredients: Wild mountain apples and plums that must be in season and cannot be substituted. This mezcal is the rarest we have ever encountered. Pechuga begins with Minero mezcal that has already been double distilled. In preparation for a third distillation, they place about 100 liters of mezcal in the still and add about 100 kilos of wild mountain apples and plums, big red plantain bananas, pineapples, a handful of almonds and a few pounds of uncooked white rice. Next, a whole chicken breast (pechuga), skin removed, bone structure complete, is washed in running water for about three hours to remove any grease. This is then suspended by strings in the atmosphere of the still and a 24 hour, third distillation is begun. The vapor passes over the pechuga and condenses into a crystal clear liquid that has an amazing taste and smoothness. The reason for the breast they say is so the mezcal is not dominated by the fruit\u2026a balance. Upon completion, the pechuga is removed from the still and hung in the family Altar room\u2026the most important space in the house."},

Respecting the land, the soil and the climate nourishes a genuine and thorough understanding of terroir and the results are pure Bruichladdich."},

{"title": "Bimini Overproof Gin", "price": "36.99", "vendor": "Bimini Gin", "description": "Bimini Overproof has more flavor than regular Bimini Gin because none of the botancial oils are filtered out. Why is regular Bimini Gin filtered? Oils dissolve in alcohol, but they separate from water. When we dilute the original Bimini Gin to 94 proof, the botanical oils begin to fall out of solution making the gin appear cloudy. We didn\u2019t think the world was ready to buy a bottle of cloudy gin, so we filtered out just enough oil to keep regular Bimini Gin clear at room temp. At 111 proof, Bimini Overproof stays crystal clear at room temp with no filtration necessary. This means every drop of flavor we\u2019ve extracted from our botanicals goes into the bottle. Filtration removes more of some botanical oils than others, which means Bimini Overproof has a different balance of flavors than regular Bimini Gin.

One of the Elgin crowd in the Speyside region of Scotland, the distillery has sprawled across the greenest of land since 1821, and over the generations has lived in anonymity due to its role with Scotland\u2019s blenders. Its relative scarcity compared to the nearby distillers that have lived with fame and ubiquity makes Linkwood single malt that well-kept secret you really don\u2019t want to tell anyone about.

Tradicional\u00ae Plata is 100% blue agave silver tequila and has followed the same Cuervo family recipe since 1795. It is irresistibly refined. When bottled, a special process is used to conserve its flavor and finish at freezing temperatures. This means that it can, and should, be kept chilled in the freezer and served as a crisp, smooth, frozen shot or in a cocktail like a classic Paloma."},

{"title": "That Boutique-y Whisky Company Highland Park 18 Year Old Batch 6", "price": "199.99", "vendor": "That Boutique-y Whisky Company", "description": "Living on the rugged Isle of Orkney, Highland Park is a much-loved Scotch whisky distillery. They produce peated whisky, but it\u2019s quite a bit different to the style of whisky you\u2019d find on Islay - it\u2019s a touch sweeter and more herbaceous, though yummy coastal air still wafts through some Highland Park whiskies. The label features the gang from Maltstock 2012, with one addition to the crew - the ghost of Charlemagne! He\u2019s throwing his pants up in a tree in the woods of Overasselt, which is said to be good luck.

{"title": "Alexander Murray Glenturret 34 Year Old 1982", "price": "259.99", "vendor": "Alexander Murray", "description": "A delightful wee distillery in heart of Strathearn in the Highland region, Glenturret is quaint mix of one of the smallest and oldest distilleries in Scotland. Nested in the rolling hills amongst the trees, it\u2019s hard to argue with its claim to being an age-old site of illicit spirit distillation \u2013 as early as the late eighteenth century apparently. Producing very small volumes of whisky for its owner, Edrington, and rarely seen as a standalone single malt, Glenturret has inherited a slightly anonymous identity over the years. Alongside this, the distillery\u2019s simple and unsophisticated setup naturally yields faintly inconsistent spirit character. This makes Glenturret a jamboree of peculiarities and idiosyncrasies that are so interesting to the seasoned malt drinker. Profile of the spirit character dances between light and perfumed, however what\u2019s usually guaranteed is intensity of flavor. Single malt releases are few and far between, and older vintages of Glenturret are particularly rare."},
{"title": "Alexander Murray Benrinnes 19 Year Old 1995", "price": "119.99", "vendor": "Alexander Murray", "description": "As the name suggests, the distillery sits at the very foot of Ben Rinnes and has done since 1835. A wee hiccup in choice of location caused the original distillery, on a site very nearby, to succumb to flooding just three years into its life, in 1829. Owned by Diageo, Benrinnes for years performed the role of producing a meaty and sulfury style of whisky vital to the company\u2019s wider blending program through a traditional and intricate distillation method. In those years, a partial-triple distillation was favored, an alternative process that manipulates alcohol\u2019s journey through stills and receivers to limit the reduction of sulfury compounds. On top of this worm tub condensers are used, making the entire process very similar to that of its sister distillery, Mortlach. Alas, this glorious distillation method was simplified in 2007, leaving less influence on the character of vintages since. Today, Benrinnes maintains the sulfury profile. This very distinct style of spirit, whilst quite rough before going into the cask, takes on wonderfully diverse flavors during maturation. From refill Bourbon casks, which often develop playful, floral whiskies, to first-fill Sherry casks, which develop rich umami-type whiskies, there\u2019s incredible variety found in malts from here. Undeviating, however, is a body and texture that is quite distinct in style."},
{"title": "The Glenrothes 1992", "price": "319.99", "vendor": "The Glenrothes", "description": "This 2nd edition of the Glenrothes 1992 Vintage Single Malt is aged 10 years longer than the original release bottled in 2004. These are the very same casks chosen for the 1st release, left aside to mature longer in both refill sherry and ex-bourbon barrels, making it the first vintage of the Glenrothes to be matured entirely in refill casks. It should be noted that the whisky was originally produced by Malt Master John Ramsay and the casks for this edition bottled by his successor, Gordon Motion. It is also non-chill filtered."},

{"title": "Alexander Murray Mortlach 19 Year Old 1995", "price": "124.99", "vendor": "Alexander Murray", "description": "Colloquially known as \u2018The Beast of Dufftown\u2019 for very good reason. When James Findlater founded Mortlach in 1823, the first distillery in what would eventually become a prolific whisky-producing community, he created a single malt whisky so brutish and audacious in character that no person dare entertain the notion of altering its method of distillation, despite its convolution. Distillation here is configured in such a way that the No. 1 spirit still \u2013 known at the distillery as \u2018Wee Witchie\u2019 \u2013 is utilized to distill the \u2018weak feints\u2019 three times during the same run. The resulting spirit, according to the distillation team, is an aggregated 2.81 times distilled, and drawn diagrammatically is enough to leave you tipsy. All of this tradition is upheld in order to promote a very meaty and sulfury spirit, which is so important for Diageo\u2019s blending program, the distillery\u2019s owner. As an extreme example of this style, Mortlach has robust body, which means it can withstand prolonged aging without succumbing to the flavor found in the wood in which it is matured, and if less mature or matured in refill casks, retains vibrant smoked-meat characteristics."},

An unprecedented alliance of age and finesse, it embodies the apogee of the art of selection and the relentless quest for finesse throughout eight generations of Master Blenders from the Fillioux family. From any given harvest, the average number of eaux-de-vie with the potential to one day join this blend are rather rare: only 10 out of 10 000. Identifying and nurturing such finesse requires ultimate expertise and talent. The Master Blender's savoir-faire is also to define the right ageing conditions to raise a fine eau-de-vie to its point of elegance, i.e. the decisive and fleeting moment when it reaches its apogee, ready to join the blend. Hennessy Paradis Imperial is characterized by its unique character, combining unexpected contrasts and an elegant grace. Its golden hue is surprisingly lighter than that of other old cognacs. This is due to the use of mature oak casks, which have few tannins, to preserve finesse. Likewise, despite the age of its eaux-de-vie, Hennessy Paradise Imperial features a light structure and an absolutely delicate yet persistent finish thanks to its floral notes that are as pure and crisp as a spring day, edged with a smoky, spicy accent. Color: Hennessy Paradis Imperial light and surprising golden color comes from the choice of barrel. Lacking a high level of tannins, they cannot affect such refined eaux-de-vie. Nose: Hennessy Paradis Imperial delicately exudes several floral notes as if the freshness of Spring had suddenly bloomed.

Barrel aging naturally imparts both the straw color and subtle sweet notes that complement the unique characteristics of a traditional mezcal. The herbal, smoky taste of the cooked maguey is softened on the palate by the delicate tinge of vanilla and caramel. This beautifully rounded flavor finishes smoothly and cleanly."},

Their prize agricultural crops, barley and apples respectively, have a long, shared history of usage together, particularly in baking.

We have been blending Calvados with Scotch whisky at home and in our blending room for years, enchanted by their complementary qualities.

{"title": "Alexander Murray Glen Moray 12 Year Old 2002", "price": "94.99", "vendor": "Alexander Murray", "description": "A criminally under-rated distillery in our view at Alexander Murray & Co. Casks we sample from here consistently exhibit all the exciting, fragrant characteristics you\u2019d want in a soft, intriguing dram. Glen Moray is a first-class example of the citrusy and perfumed style. Most often you\u2019ll find Glen Moray matured in ex-bourbon casks, which suit well to the development of the spirit. However the distillery also houses all sorts of treasures: single malt matured in an impressive collection of wine, sherry, port, madeira and even \u2018ex-cider\u2019 casks. The distillery is situated in Elgin on the site of an old brewery, which was converted in 1897, and thrives today, albeit as a lesser-known champion of Speyside. Fragrant, fruity, citrusy, biscuity and sometimes even buttery, you can always expect something lively from Glen Moray. We hear that the production setup has been altered slightly of late, moving towards a slightly longer fermentation. This will likely change the distillery character \u2013 probably giving a bit more oiliness \u2013 so there ought to be a mad dash to secure the last fruits of its traditional labor in coming years. We\u2019ll certainly be knocking at the door."},
{"title": "Alexander Murray Braes of Glenlivet 1994", "price": "299.99", "vendor": "Alexander Murray", "description": "Originally named Braes of Glenlivet due to its proximity to the Glenlivet Estate, the name was changed to Braeval, avoiding confusion and potential misinterpreted association with The Glenlivet Distillery and brand, as did other proximate distilleries such as Dailuaine and Tomintoul. Nestled in a delightfully moody glen in the small community of Chapeltown, Ballindalloch, Braeval shares the same altitude as the Dalwhinnie Distillery, making it joint-highest distillery in Scotland. The greenery and purity of the location is vivid, the stuff of nature documentaries. Built in 1974 by Chivas, Braeval is the slightly-prettier sister to Allt-a-Bhainne Distillery nearby. Like its sister, Braeval is a modern distillery embracing a model of high technology, low manpower; its spirit is sent off-site for maturation, destined to play in the blended-whisky orchestra when it reaches maturity. If you can find yourself a single-malt bottling of Braeval/Braes of Glenlivet then you\u2019re in for a real treat. The intensely fruity style is fantastic. For all of us at Alexander Murray & Co, the nose of a Braeval takes us back to the \u2018Fruit Salad\u2019 candy you\u2019d only get in childhood if you chased the ice cream van when it came to town."},
{"title": "Alexander Murray Allt-A-Bhainne 23 Year Old 1993", "price": "144.99", "vendor": "Alexander Murray", "description": "Perhaps best known for its most unintuitive Gaelic pronunciation [oltah-vain], Allt-a-Bhainne \u2013 meaning \u2018burn of milk\u2019 \u2013 has stood at the foot of Ben Rinnes in Speyside since 1975. Built by its owners, Chivas, its role is to produce a single malt of a particular type for the use in blended whisky. Braeval, its sister distillery (formally Braes of Glenlivet), was built at the same time during ongoing efforts to improve the company\u2019s wider blending program. Allt-a-Bhainne has scarcely enjoyed a faultless reputation over its relatively short life. In fact, the distillery\u2019s rugged fa\u00e7ade and grumpy architecture give its whisky a fairly unromantic perception from the outset, and some of the whiskies from its first decade of production are a little off-the-mark here and there. This is a real shame, as we have latterly found that the distillery has really found its feet, with vintages consistently displaying amazing texture and flavor. Allt-a-Bhainne is not often the most complex single malt in a lineup, but for those who enjoy a somewhat sweet and textured whisky, it\u2019s a champion. \u2018Burn of milk\u2019 \u2013 a sweet, creamy specialist."},
{"title": "Alexander Murray Glen Keith 21 Year Old 1995", "price": "299.99", "vendor": "Alexander Murray", "description": "The site of experimental distillation trial and error for Chivas, Glen Keith was converted in 1960 on the site of an old corn mill in the Speyside town of Keith. Well-established Strathisla is very nearby, also part of the Chivas team of distilleries. Originally kitted out with three stills, the Glen Keith ran a triple distillation process in its early years, making it stick out as a bit of an oddity in the region, with two more being added in 1970 to adopt the more conventional double distillation process. A wide range of new-make spirit has been produced here over the years, and vintages can be scattered in profile and flavor. Today the distillery maintains a light profile with pronounced fruitiness, not too dissimilar to the likes of Bladnoch Distillery way down south. Fresh, cheerful and most amenable to the influence of oak, this malt will always excites. Rarely monotonous despite its simplicity."},
{"title": "Alexander Murray Ardmore 9 Year Old 2008", "price": "69.99", "vendor": "Alexander Murray", "description": "Although categorized as a Highland whisky, Ardmore flirts heavily with the South-east peripherals of Speyside, lying boisterously at the foot of the Grampian hills. Big and brash, it is also known for flirting heavily with peat, at least some of the time that is. Built in 1989 for the purpose of producing single malt for blends, Teacher\u2019s opted to make peated whisky here. This move alleviated the company\u2019s reliance on Islay\u2019s producers of peated whisky to add smokiness to blends \u2013 a particularly astute decision, given the growing popularity of Scotch whisky at the time. Today, since the distillery adopted steam during distillation rather than coal fires, two spirit characters are made here, a practice that is becoming increasingly prevalent. Both spirit styles are produced at separate times of the year, in which the point of difference in production is the Phenol level of the barley delivered to the distillery, i.e. the level of peat used in drying. \u2018Ardmore\u2019 is the heavily peated single malt; \u2018Ardlair\u2019, or \u2018Ardless\u2019 as it\u2019s sometimes known, is the unpeated single malt. Worth noting is that, although each spirit is vastly different in character, because Ardmore and Ardlair are from the same distillery, they can be vatted (or married) together and still be called a single malt. Ardlair can also be labeled as \u2018Ardmore Distillery\u2019. A little tricky, but well worth knowing. Sometimes big, brash, earthy and smoky; sometimes subtle, floral and fruity. A real Jekyll and Hyde distillery. Let your nose prepare you accordingly."},

Each tree was then cut into two parts - top and bottom - yielding 192 unique tree sections. A single barrel was constructed from each section. Prior to construction, the stave seasoning was varied. The 192 barrels were then charred differently. These single oak barrels were then filled with different recipe whiskeys, at various entry proofs and aged in a variety of different warehouse styles. This experiment allows whiskey connoisseurs to directly compare the impact of seven different critical variables across 192 bottles for a total of 1,396 taste combinations.

Displaying this depth from first glance, the bottle\u2019s display of the colors signify the layering of the tastes and aromas used by Hennessy's cellar master in the making of their blends. JonOne is a Dominican Republic born street artist who now commits his works of art to the canvas as well. Hennessy JonOne Deluxe Edition Gift Set is an extension of the latest Limited Edition by Cognac Hennessy in 2017. Both an excellent display and palate that offers a unique edge. To create the eaux-de-vie for Hennessy\u2019s signature VS, the finest Ugni Blanc grapes are selected, fermented and distilled twice in copper pot stills, known locally as alembic charentais. While some producers choose to distil their spirit with grape skins and other types of sediment, Hennessy removes this to create a lighter and more delicate Cognac. After distillation, only the best eaux-de-vie will be selected during tasting sessions held by a select committee of experts, with the final blend crafted by Hennessy\u2019s eighth-generation master blender, Renaud Fillioux de Gironde. Maison Hennessy uses casks of French Limousin oak to age their VS Cognac, imparting a robust, nutty note to complement the light and fruity grape characteristics. Before they even get to touch the spirit, the wood for the casks has been left outside for several years, exposing it to the changing seasons to reduce bitter flavors and develop a natural vanilla sweetness. Tasting notes: Colour - Deep golden color with flashes of ruby. Nose - Fruity aromas of citrus, apple and grape. Complemented by French oak and toasted almonds. A warming presence of vanilla lingers at the back. Palate - Young and vibrant. Fresh grape and green apples at the forefront, complemented with orange and wood. Hints of ginger beneath the surface that develops into warming winter spices - cinnamon and clove."},

To add nuance, the Cabernet is blended with Merlot, yielding a wine that is approachable in its youth, yet worthy of cellaring. Lush, energetic and intense, this gorgeous Cabernet begins with aromas of blackberry, huckleberry and chocolate, as well as hints of mint, cardamom, clove and graham cracker. On the palate it displays lovely brightness, with firm, resolved tannins framing flavors of boysenberry and black currant. As it evolves in the glass, subtle sweet and savory notes are revealed, carrying the wine to a long, focused finish. The 2017 growing season began with abundant winter rains, followed by a warm, dry spring that led to a perfectly timed budbreak. In addition to replenishing the water table, the early season rains produced robust canopies, which provided invaluable shade during a week-long heat event that kicked harvest into gear during the last week of August. This was followed by a much-needed cooldown that allowed the vines to recuperate, while also giving us extra hangtime for flavor development and tannin resolution. We harvested throughout September and into early October, with the grapes showing lovely ripeness and quality, yielding plush, polished and wonderfully complex wines."},

The length and quality of the growing season ensured that we had numerous beautiful lots to choose from when blending, resulting in wines with vibrant aromatics, bold textures and wonderful complexity and richness."},

Fourteen years later, Ed Hamilton \u2014 the swashbuckling Caribbean trader turned crusading \u201cpure rum\u201d importer and blender \u2014 was drinking with the Bum at Latitude 29 when our talk turned to the challenge of recreating the complicated exotic cocktails of the last century. Over the next two years we experimented with umpteen rum mixes trying to create a one-bottle blend that could reanimate your Zombie, fuel your Jet Pilot, and punch up your favorite Tiki Classics without having to inventory three different rums. This blend had to be more than a high-octane slug of rum, but rather bring balance to the final drink through a subtle marriage of multiple distillates. The end result of our collaboration: Hamilton Beachbum Berry\u2019s Zombie Blend Rum. Purists may point out that the original 1934 Zombie recipe of 1 1/2 oz Puerto Rican rum, 1 1/2 oz Jamaican rum and 1 oz of Demerara 151 adds up to twice the amount of rum as our Zombie recipe below, which calls for a mere 2 oz of our 118-proof rum \u2014 and they\u2019d be right! So what\u2019s missing? Basically, more water in the rum bottle. The less water, the more concentrated the rum, and the more intense the rum flavors. With the high ABV of the Beachbum Zombie Blend, you get that flavor at half the volume. And at a fraction of the time, trouble and cost of mixing a Zombie with three different bottles.

Not to be confused with lower calories or an Edison light bulb, \"light\" denotes a grain spirit distilled between 80-95% alcohol by volume (ABV) - it's \"lighter\" than a straight whiskey (which is distilled to <80% ABV) but \"heavier\" than neutral grain spirits (what is called NGS and makes vodka) which must be distilled >95%. However, most light whiskeys is distilled to 94.5% ABV so it's almost NGS! Distilling that high removes almost all the congeners, the chemicals other than ethanol that whiskey lovers call \"flavor.\" Light whiskey isn't common in the U.S because we prefer our \"heavier\" straight whiskeys. However, light whiskeys has an important role to play in the world of whiskey. It is the \"dilutant\" in about 95% of the world's blended whiskeys. In the U.K, what they call grain whiskeys is more or less tha same thing as light whiskey. It gets blended with heavier malt whiskey to make blended scotch. In North America, light whiskey gets blended with heavier straight whiskeys to make blended Canadian (about 95% of all Canadian whiskey) as well as most American blended whiskeys that are not blended straight whiskeys. We were lucky to find 100 barrels of light whiskey produced from corn and aged in 2nd fill barrels. That time in wood had an amazing effect on the \"light\" spirit, imparting incredible vanilla and white chocolate notes. This is a rare and beautiful spirit that's not likely to ever be made again for a long time. Drink slowly and enjoy!"},

This climate makes for later-ripening and longer-hanging grapes with a delightful fruitiness, great acidity and underlying flavor nuances that contribute additional complexity.

With Compass Box No Name No. 3, the sequence in exploring the Scotch whisky's smoky spectrum can come to a fitting conclusion. Fans of the first No Name will recognise a strumming tarry intensity, while the fruity fragrance hinted at in No Name, No.2 has been given a tropical makeover.

Barrels that produce 100 proof bourbon will yield approximately 200 bottles and, depending on proof, barrel strength selections will produce approximately 160 bottles.

The high proof, and the effects of full-term 1st fill sherry butt maturation, results in one dense, full whisky. It oozes fruity notes, landing somewhere between spiced mulled wine and spiked sangria, but still, at the same time, doesn't drink overly sweet; the ABV, spice notes, and malt character all work together to counterbalance any notion of over sweetness, landing on an incredibly balanced, beautifully composed sherried dram.

{"title": "Martell V.S.O.P. Aged in Red Barrels Cognac", "price": "49.99", "vendor": "Martell", "description": "When you're searching for a cognac with complex flavors and aromas, turn to the classic Martell VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale). Before you pour your drink, admire the signature bottle bearing a Louis XIV gold medallion. Martell VSOP is a dry, medium cognac, imported from the Cognac commune of the Charente department in France. Delivering 200 years of history and a flavor that is highly regarded among connoisseurs of fine liqueurs, Martell VSOP contains notes of raisins and cream, followed by more delicate flavors of toasted oats, mild spices, and hay. While the sweet, deep flavors of caramelized prunes and other dried fruits and a sharp pepper tone make Martell VSOP a delicious choice on its own, it also works well with lemonade or soda, or in other simple mixed drinks. Martell VSOP is 40 percent ABV, and the deep, eye-catching copper color of this premium liquor is sure to impress. There is a reason why Cognac is the only region allowed to produce this sophisticated spirit: the expert blend of only the finest high-quality mature ingredients from the department itself means this is a drink that cannot be imitated.

{"title": "Signatory Single Cask Caol Ila 8YR (Cask #318694)", "price": "93.99", "vendor": "Signatory", "description": "Caol Ila is a distillery well-known to Scotch fans. Hailing from Port Askaig on the famed isle of Islay, this distillery's character typically offers industrial oils, maritime notes, and, while it shows plenty of smoke, that profile is usually somewhat more delicate and clean compared to other Islay whiskies. It has long been a component in Diageo's Johnnie Walker blends and has only recently been offered as a Single Malt. Rarer still is to find it as a Single Cask bottling. In this case, a milder peated Islay may never before have been bottled. Give it a bit of time to open up and this is a wonderfully gentle Islay dram that shows a different side of Caol Ila - one expressing peat as typically found in much, much older whiskies: earthy, organic, and almost vegetal, rather than in your face with smoke. The smoke hardly shows itself at all until the finish, where it appears and lingers gently and aromatically like cigar smoke hanging in a room well after the stick was put out. Here you get a lot of Islay with the smoke on mute - coastal, natural, and mineralic. Bottle Size: 750ml"},
{"title": "Signatory Single Cask Ardmore 9YR (Cask #706260)", "price": "78.99", "vendor": "Signatory", "description": "When people think of smokey whisky their minds immediately turn to Islay with its salty, iodine-laden peat. But this is not representative of the whole. Ardmore, in the Scottish Highlands, uses a much more delicate peat that introduces floral notes, roasted sweets, and even grilled meat flavors on occasion. The peat smoke also plays more of a complementary role, making Ardmore far more approachable and even delicate - especially when compared with what people have in their minds for peated Scotch. This specific single cask of Ardmore strikes a unique balance, having been aged in Bourbon Barrels (enhancing the sweeter notes) which previously were used to age Islay whiskies (providing a subtle boost to Ardmore's typical smokiness). It clearly has peat and smoke, but is surprisingly light, smooth, and drinks with a sweet earthiness surrounded by fragrant smoke. The Highland peat pairs well with that re-used Islay cask to yield a complex peat profile that is totally unexpected for something 9 years old: with enough oomph to appease peat freaks but enough delicate complexity for those who find youthful Islay too intense.

Despite spending all of its 13 years in a 1st Fill Sherry Barrel, the distinct Glenlivet character shines front and center, with Sherry acting as a partner, accentuating certain elements and introducing some novel others. You are taken on a long, evolving journey beginning at confectionary sweets, passing through a cornucopia of berries, stone fruit, and spices, then landing in an earthy semi-sweet place recalling pairings of dark chocolate and fine cordials. All the while a bright, rather clean, traditionally Glenlivet character forms the backbone around which these other flavors are explored. Here is a bottle that introduces a whole new depth to a known distillery without abandoning the character that's made it the top selling Single Malt in America. If you're a fan of Glenlivet, or find yourself enjoying malts that lean into the spiced side of sherry (like those from the likes of Dalmore, Glenfarclas, Glendronach, and Tamdhu), then you will find this Single Cask offering to be your new whisky obsession.

Consistency : The flavor profile provided by using St. Vincent Syrups is always the same, allowing your bar to create consistent cocktails without variations based on fruit ripeness. 2. Speed : Using syrups allows for greater speed of service, by eliminating the need for muddling and straining out solids/seeds. It also allows the bartender to batch cocktails for large format service, or to reduce pour times during regular service. 3. Flavor : The use of an ingredient like orgeat is a great way to get a flavor profile on a cocktail that is not achievable any other way. Muddling almonds doesn't really work. 4. Price : With all ingredient and production costs considered, these advantages come with the added benefit of a lowered pour cost vs. in-house production."},

Lindemans Kriek is a good example of that. In order to obtain a beer like no other, the family has been adding whole sour cherries to our lambic for generations. Meeting with American importer, Charles Finkel, in the 1970s revolutionized the fruit beer segment. Charles convinced us to export our old kriek to the United States by boat. What we had not thought of is that the movement of the waves would reactivate the fermentation process and cause the corks to pop during the trip. It was like something out of The Adventures of Tintin. To prevent that from happening, we therefore developed an alternative production method for our kriek. We use fresh, not from concentrate, unsweetened cherry filtrate which we blend with lambic that is at least one year old before fermenting & macerating for up to 3 days and pasteurizing the whole batch. So the corks don't pop. Due to the use of filtrate and pasteurization, this kriek is sweeter and fruitier than Oude Kriek Cuv\u00e9e Ren\u00e9, which undergoes a second fermentation process in the bottle. Thanks to its innovative flavor, it was a resounding success both here in Belgium as well as around the world.

It combined Ugni Blanc with the pale, fruity wines of the Parellada variety, grown on the high slopes of the Upper Pened\u00e8s. The base wines undergo double distillation in traditional copper pot stills to produce pure and aromatic wine spirits. Over the course of many years, these delicate wine spirits age in selected oak casks, gradually developing warm aromas of spices and an elegant palate. The bottle is inspired by a decanter that dates back to the second generation of the Torres family. The heirloom survives to this day, handed down through generations.

Rancio is a much-prized yet elusive aroma found particularly in high end Cognacs, Armagnacs, and other brandies that were distilled with a lot of fatty acids. The aroma of \u201crancio\u201d is technically the oxidized esters of fatty acids, of which Cigar Blend Batch #16 seems to have in abundance. It seems that this particular barrel was previously filled with an Armagnac that exhibited a lot of these type of notes, and so it has imparted these notes into the bourbon. In this batch, which was finished in a 400 liter freshly dumped Armagnac cask, we find a lot of fruity top notes of with Medjool date and California Mission fig, stewed prunes in Armagnac syrup, along with ginger snap cookie, orange marmalade, Tawny Port, dark dried fruit notes of stewed prunes. There is also a tang of Roquefort cheese with a touch of Atlantic ocean brine, graphite from pencil shavings, and Turron de Alicante (Spanish almond nougat).

Sometimes seen under its older \u2018Tomintoul-Glenlivet\u2019 guise, like a handful of nearby \u2018piggy-backers\u2019 it adopted the popular \u2018Glenlivet\u2019 name, then later reverted. Its character is entirely different to The Glenlivet. A distillery that labels itself as a \u2018gentle dram\u2019, Tomintoul arguable makes an authentic claim. Typically you can expect a soft delivery from all that they bottle, most likely to create whisky that is very approachable, we have to guess. If you think what is required to describe a whisky as \u2018smooth\u2019 then you\u2019re probably not too far away from the delivery of Tomintoul. In saying that, straight from the cask Tomintoul has a definite bite about it, displaying all of the barley sugar and raisin characteristics that contribute to its gentle perception, yet also showing a thick, waxy quality that adds a layer of oomph. Be careful of the heavily-peated variant sometimes produced at the distillery \u2013 Ballantruan \u2013 for it is far from gentle."},

The first is known as Tobermory, an unpeated and slightly oily spirit that often develops in many directions; the second is known as Ledaig, a heavily-peated spirit that retains a particularly powerful smokiness.
